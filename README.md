# GraphQl Project Management App
This project management app allows users to upload clients and projects for those clients and keep track of everything in one place. Users can edit project details and indicate progress

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, Apollo Client, MongoDB, Mongoose

I used GraphQL to handle all the queries being made to MongoDB. I used mongoose to create the schemas for my model to interact with MongoDB and the back end was built with Express/Node. On the front-end I used Apollo Client to help utilizing my queries for GraphQL and displayed it all with React. I used bootstrap for styling.

## Optimizations

One feature I am working on but didn't quite get working was to create a modal from the dashboard that will allow users to edit the information for a client. Currently, the client must be deleted and readded.

## Lessons Learned:

 I got to utilize GraphQL for the first time in this project and found that integrating it in the backend was fairly easy and very intuitive. Using Apollo Client definitely created a slight leanring curve for the front-end but by the end it made the project a lot esier to develop.
